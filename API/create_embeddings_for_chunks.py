    Fetches all course descriptions from the database, splits each description
    into smaller text chunks, generates a vector embedding for each chunk using
    OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model, and stores the results in the Chunks
    table via the procInsertChunk stored procedure.

    Output (written to the database):
        - ChunkText   : A substring of the original course description (max 250 chars,
                        with 20-char overlap between adjacent chunks to preserve context).
        - Embedding   : A JSON-serialized list of 1536 floats representing the semantic
                        meaning of the chunk in vector space.
        - CourseID    : Foreign key linking the chunk back to its source course.

    Console output:
        - Prints a confirmation line for each CourseID after its chunks are committed.
        - Prints a final summary line when all courses have been processed.
